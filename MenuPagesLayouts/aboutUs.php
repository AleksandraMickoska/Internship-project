            Wine & Dine’s credible editorial has been the cornerstone of making the publication the definitive magazine for gourmands for the past 38 years. The first issue was founded and published by Juliet David in 1983.

            In its latest reiteration, the magazine is a bi-monthly amalgamation of well-researched, long-form articles on food culture and how what we eat continues to shape the world we know.

            Each issue takes on a universal theme that is a reflection of the current climate of the F&B industry and beyond, and includes interviews with the chefs and vintners you should be keeping an eye out for.

            It’s published alongside the magazine’s website where you’ll find the latest news from the region and abroad.

            Being a gourmand means we appreciate good food no matter where it comes from; expect to see award-winning restaurants of international acclaim featured alongside veterans of traditional food and a new generation of chefs dabbling in experimental, genre-defying cuisine.

            Wine & Dine also publishes the annual Singapore’s Top Restaurants guide and SG Top Cafes guide.
